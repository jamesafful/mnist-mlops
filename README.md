# MNIST MLOps Project

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The pipeline includes model training with PyTorch, monitoring with Weights and Biases (W&B), deployment with FastAPI, and containerization using Docker.

## Technologies Used
- PyTorch
- FastAPI
- Weights and Biases (W&B)
- Docker

## Instructions for Running the Code Locally
